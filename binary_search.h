 * @param haystack The sorted list in which the `needle` is searched.
 * @param criterion The pointer to the function that implements the sorting criterion of the list.
 * That function accepts two integer parameters and returns a boolean value.
 * @param needle The value to find within the haystack.
 * @return The index of the `needle` within the list if it was found or the position where the needle need to
 * be inserted into the sorted list if it is not included in the list. The insertion position is 
 * expressed as index with negative sign, so that the value can be inserted at index (-1 * result).
